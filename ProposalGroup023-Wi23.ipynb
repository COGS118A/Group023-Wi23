    "# Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your ML system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

So use the method that works for you, but do use inline citations.\n",

We consider \"opening price\", \"high\", \"low\", \"closing price\", \"volume\", and \"stock trading\" to be critical variables. Every variable is represented by an integer value and every variable except volume is in terms of Japanese Yen ¥. Our dataset is complete and will not require any cleaning. We may rename the \"stock trading\" variable to \"trading value\" for easier understanding."

We will use K-Fold cross validation since our sample size is low (1227) to assess our model's performance and make the most of our small dataset. Some libraries that we plan to use are NumPy, SKlearn, and Matplotlib. Some benchmark models we may compare our model against are linear regression and a trivial mean predictor."
