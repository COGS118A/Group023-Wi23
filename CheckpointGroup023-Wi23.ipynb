    "# Abstract \n",
    "In this project, our goal is to predict Uniqlo closing stock prices from a dataset we procured from Kaggle. Each data point in our dataset contains Uniqlo opening, high, low, and closing stock prices as well as volume of stocks traded and trading values from Jan 2012 - Dec 2016. This data was taken from the Japanese stock market. With our data we will be using a random forest model along with k-fold cross validation to predict closing stock prices per day. To evaluate the success of our model we will compare our predictions to the actual Uniqlo closing stock price. Our model's performance will be evaluated on statistical metrics such as root mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean squared error."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting stock prices has been a popular research area in the field of machine learning and finance for a long time. Various studies have been conducted to predict stock prices using different algorithms and techniques. The majority of these studies have focused on analyzing historical stock price data, company financial reports, and other macroeconomic indicators to make predictions about future stock prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "One popular approach to stock price prediction is time series analysis. Time series analysis involves using past prices and other relevant variables to forecast future prices. There are many different models that can be used for time series analysis, including autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) models, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) <a name=\"Tsay\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#Tsay) <a name=\"Engle\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#Engle) <a name=\"Hochreiter\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#Hochreiter).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another popular approach to stock price prediction is machine learning. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to learn patterns in historical data and use those patterns to make predictions about future prices. Popular machine learning algorithms for stock price prediction include support vector machines (SVMs), random forests, and gradient boosting machines (GBMs) <a name=\"Zhang\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#Zhang) <a name=\"Zhang2\"></a>[<sup>[5]</sup>](#Zhang2).\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks have been applied to stock price prediction with promising results. These techniques can capture complex patterns in historical data and make accurate predictions about future prices <a name=\"Zhang3\"></a>[<sup>[6]</sup>](#Zhang3) <a name=\"Qiu\"></a>[<sup>[7]</sup>](#Qiu)."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we aim to use a Random Forest Algorithm to predict the daily closing stock prices of the Japanese clothing company Uniqlo from January 2012 - December 2016. To accomplish this, we will analyze factors such as opening stock price, daily highs and lows, trading volume, and trading value of Uniqlo stock. Since our data is procured from the Tokyo Stock Exchange, we will be quantifying stock prices in terms of Japanese Yen (¥) to match our dataset. Furthermore, our problem is measureable because we can calculate our model's accuracy by taking the difference between our model's predicted closing stock prices and the actual closing stock prices and measure error with metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or Mean Squared Error (MSE). Finally, our problem is replicable because a machine learning model can be used to predict more recent Uniqlo closing stock prices such as from 2017 to 2023."

    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Link to our dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/daiearth22/uniqlo-fastretailing-stock-price-prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset contains 1227 observations organized by date and 7 variables. Each observation consists of a date, opening price, high, low, closing price, volume, and stock trading value. We consider \"opening price\", \"high\", \"low\", \"closing price\", \"volume\", and \"stock trading\" to be critical variables. Every variable is represented by an integer value and every variable except volume is in terms of Japanese Yen ¥. \n",
    "\n",
    "Update:\n",
    "In terms of cleaning and transformations for our data, we did not have to do much. We planned on using all the variables included within the training dataset, with only minor modifications. We had originally planned to set the \"date\" values as the indices for our new dataset but these plans were stymied by the discontinuity of date values. Given stock market regulations, trading does not occur on weekends or holidays, leaving irregular holes in our date values. Thus, we stuck to using numerical indices from 1 through 1226.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the training and test datasets were also in reverse-chronological order, meaning one of our first steps was reversing the datasets and validating the new datasets were in the correct order. Lastly, we changed the \"stock trading\" column into a \"trading value\" column to better convey the actual significance of the variable's values. "

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Using our Uniqlo dataset, we want to predict its closing stock price, while measuring performance. To do so, our project will utilize the Random Forest algorithm, which we believe will work based on the past success of others who have it used for stock prediction. We will run the model using various combinations of the possible features (\"opening price\", \"high\", \"low\", \"closing price\", \"volume\", and \"stock trading\") in order to determine which features result in the best performance. High performing features will result in the lowest MSE between actual and predicted closing prices. We will use K-Fold cross validation since our sample size is low (1227) to assess our model's performance and make the most of our small dataset. Some libraries that we plan to use are NumPy, SKlearn, and Matplotlib. Some benchmark models we may compare our model against are linear regression and a trivial mean predictor."

    "# Preliminary results\n",
    "\n",
    "For our preliminary results, we decided to evaluate the performance of a default linear regression model on our dataset. We measured error in terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). We found Mean Absolute Error to be a a largely irrelevant metric as it gives an equal weight to all errors and fails to account for direction. In the case of the stock market, this can be incorrectly predicting a stock to fall when it rises, or vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our model produced a MSE of JP¥75490.942 and RMSE of JP¥274.756. Looking at the training data, we can see that the average values all stay around the JP¥33000 range. This means that on average, our basic linear regression model is about .8% off from the actual average stock prices. While this result isn't a concrete indicator of accuracy, the relatively small RMSE value indicates our preliminary model is within the ballpark of the real values. We aim to produce a model that outperforms this preliminary linear regression model using the Random Forest Algorithm that we learned in class.\n",

    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating the success of our model, we will compare the predictions to the actual Uniqlo stock prices. For our evaluation metrics, we plan to use statistical metrics such as root mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean squared error for calculating risks and evaluating the prediction accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mean absolute error is the absolute difference between the predicted and actual values, which can help with evaluating the size of the error. MAE is calculated by $MAE=(1/n)*\\sum |y_i-\\hat{y}_i|$\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean squared error is the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. This essentially plays a similar role to MAE, but gives more weight to larger errors. This lends itself useful in the context of our project if we want to evaluate our errors with significantly incorrect stock value predictions. The equation for MSE is $MSE=(1/n)*\\sum(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the last of the statistical metrics we'll use is root mean squared error, which essentially takes the square root of the MSE and similarly penalizes larger errors more than smaller errors, just in a more readable way. It's calculated by $RMSE=\\sqrt{(1/n)*\\sum(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why we selected MSE and RMSE in particular is due in part to the fact that stock predictions carry a lot of weight in that they can cause people to potentially gain or lose a significant amount of money. Therefore, these two evaluation metrics in particular will call attention to poor prediction models that have large errors. Therefore, we can minimize the risk of significantly penalizing those who use this model as financial advice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the goal is to ensure that it is accurately predicting the direction of the stock and the amount it increases/decreases by. As our dataset has already been separated into training and testing data, we will use the cleaned dataset to evaluate the success of our prediction model and its accuracy using these statistical metrics."

    "In terms of ethics and privacy concerns, we do not consider our project to have serious ethical implications. Theoretically, if our model were to be perfectly accurate or highly accurate in predicting Uniqlo stock prices, one could use our model in their financial interest. On the flip side, if our model were incredibly bad and it were to be publicized as a great model, it could cause people to lose a lot of money if they were to adhere to our model. As a result, it is important to clarify that our project is not financial advice and should not be used to inform any personal financial decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another concern is the potential impact on market behavior. If the model is used to make significant financial decisions, it could potentially impact the stock prices and create a feedback loop where the model's predictions influence the market behavior, which in turn affects the stock prices. This could create unintended consequences and potential ethical issues that need to be considered."
